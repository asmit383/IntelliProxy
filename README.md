🚀 IntelliProxy
An AI-Driven Adaptive Proxy Server with Real-Time Traffic Learning

IntelliProxy is an experimental proxy server that learns user traffic patterns and dynamically chooses the best route using real-time metrics and optional reinforcement learning.

Instead of traditional load balancing, IntelliProxy focuses on optimization, prediction, and intelligent routing, making it ideal for research, experimentation, and advanced networking setups.
